description: "**Simply put, Real World React is out of this world.** We wanted to
  design and develop an experience that matched this ground-breaking group of technologists.
  You may have heard of Real World React as the #1 React Meetup in the Bay Area. This
  presence has rocketed them into a successful business that we were happy to support
  with this etherial website."
