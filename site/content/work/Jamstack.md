quote: "When we talk about 'The Stack', we no longer talk about operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases. The JAMstack is not about specific technologies. Itâ€™s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience."

description: "In an open-source effort with the Netlify team we worked to create not only a documented methodology for future web development but also an award-winning website ([2017 GDUSA American Web Design Awards](http://contests.gdusa.com/2017-american-web-design-awards/awda17winner) and [One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com/jamstack)) that hosts all associated resources for the JAMstack (Javascript, APIs, and Markup). With thousands of visits daily, JAMstack.org has been a vital lifeline in establishing and expanding the adoption of this approach to web development."
