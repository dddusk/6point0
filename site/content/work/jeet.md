quote: Jeet is sleek, simple and to the point. I think they showcase the grid system

description: Jeet is a published, award-winning interactive API designed with simplicity
  in mind. We still build things the way machines read them - not the way we intuit
  them. Jeet allows you to express your page grid the same way a human would describe
  it. We had the pleasure of both designing and developing this marketing site. It
  included a completely (and beautiful) responsive design that featured an interactive
  API on desktop resolutions. This was nominated for countless awards on sites like
  Abduzeedo, CSS Design Awards, and CSS Winner but won two awards - Awwwards Site
  of the Day and Graphic Design USA's Web Design Award.
