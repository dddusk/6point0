description: This artfully crafted website was designed with the mid-century minimalist
  in mind and developed for the front-end forefront. We tastefully executed a beautiful
  design with a minimal primary palette. This is complemented by primary shapes but
  brought into the modern age with a subtle texture. The layering worked well to let
  the shapes interact with each other. Technically, it was built using the JAMstack
  and leveraged bleeding-edge CSS3 techniques; all-the-while maintaining a perfect
  score in all categories with Google's Lighthouse. We hope this piece is recognized
  as functional art; this comes especially clear on your fleeting first-time visit
  which welcomes users with a conceptual animation concerning a failure to focus.  Enjoy
  the art.
