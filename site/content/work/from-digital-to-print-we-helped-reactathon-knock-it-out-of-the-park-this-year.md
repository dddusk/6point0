description: This doodle-driven, Keith-Haring-inspired motif started as a digital
  concept and quickly evolved into a full brand. We helped the Reactathon team create
  their website through a combination of design, development, and illustration. In
  addition to a digital presence, the beauty bled off the screen and into the print
  shop where we helped them create assets for the conference including the primary
  backdrop.
