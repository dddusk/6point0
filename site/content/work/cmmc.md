description: Working with Tony and the whole Cincinnati Mine Machinery Co. Team was a delight. We set out to take their antiquated site into the 21st century with a mobile responsive design and a complete restructuring of their content/product inventory and how users navigate these channels on the site. We wanted to make it intuitive and quick, which I feel we accomplished. Furthermore, we wanted the site to serve as a resource for technical spec, historical chronicalling of the 90+ year old company. After nearly a year, the site now boasts stats such as <strong>~20k unique page views</strong> with an engaged audience who <strong>browse for an average of ~1 min and 30 seconds</strong>. Overall, we are proud partners in Cincinnati Mine Machinery Co's online success. See the success for yourself at <a href="http://cinmine.com">cinmine.com</a>.
